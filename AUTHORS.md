`ersatz` started as a one man project by [Edward Kmett](mailto:ekmett@gmail.com) [@ekmett](https://github.com/ekmett).
However, it then languished for 3 years after Don Stewart [@donsbot](https://github.com/donsbot) released perfectly adequate [bindings for yices](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yices-painless).

It was revived by [Johan Kiviniemi](mailto:ersatz@johan.kiviniemi.name) [@ion1](https://github.com/ion1) who got it into a working condition by implementing some missing parts, which inspired the original author into polishing it up and releasing it.

Eric Mertens (@glguy](https://github.com/glguy) has been pouring code into it ever since then.
